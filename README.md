# Flow Engine

Flow Engine is a fork of the Godot Engine game engine, optimized and enhanced for Pulse Studio projects.

## Why Fork?

The decision to fork Godot Engine was driven by specific requirements of Pulse Studio projects that required deeper engine modifications:

1. Custom Features
- Enhanced workflow optimizations specific to our production pipeline
- Additional tools and utilities for Pulse Studio's development needs
- Specialized rendering features and optimizations

2. Control and Flexibility
- Ability to implement critical features without waiting for upstream approval
- Direct control over the engine's development direction
- Faster implementation of project-specific requirements

## Compatibility

Flow Engine maintains compatibility with standard Godot projects while providing additional features. However, projects using Flow Engine-specific features may not be fully compatible with the standard Godot Engine.

## License

Flow Engine maintains Godot Engine's MIT license. See LICENSE file for details.

## Acknowledgments

This project is based on the excellent work of the Godot Engine community. We express our gratitude to all Godot contributors who made this possible.
